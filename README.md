Our project was done in a Jupyter notebook. We imported data from kaggle and accessed it locally. Our project is an in depth analysis of a large dataset on tennis statistics at the ATP professional level. There are some user interactive portions in the notebook for our queries.

The notebook outlines our queries of the tennis players, matches, and rankings databases. We perform large scale analysis on statistics and display them.

We take a look at the following statistics:
- General Data Analysis
- World Number 1 Ranking
- Performance by Age
- Performance by Country
- Performance by Handedness
- Player Analysis
